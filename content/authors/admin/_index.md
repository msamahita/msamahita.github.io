I am Assistant Professor at the [School of Economics](https://www.ucd.ie/economics/), [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/) and Research Fellow at the [Geary Institute for Public Policy](https://www.ucd.ie/geary/). I hold a PhD in Economics from [Lund University](https://nek.lu.se/en).

My research is in behavioural economics, where I use theoretical, empirical and (primarily) experimental methods to study individual decision-making. My current research focuses on the effects of social influence on online behaviour and political preferences. More recently, I am also interested in studying gender differences in economics and the causes and consequences of gender norms.

<!-- In particular, I focus on the effects of social norms, social influence, self-image, social image, emotions and self-control. More recently, I am also interested in studying online political behaviour and how information shapes political preferences. -->

<!--I am a member of the [Behavioural Science & Policy Group](https://bsp.ucd.ie/) and an affiliated researcher at the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/) at UCD. -->
